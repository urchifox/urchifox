Iâ€™m Kate and I'm really passionate about working with visual content, and at the same time love to solve logic questions and optimization issues. For three amazing years I was working in game-dev outsourcing studio as 2d-artist. After that I have engrossing two years working as process manager. But there was always lack of something. And now I've finally found balanced combination of all these tasks in the frontend.
